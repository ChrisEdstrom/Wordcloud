# Wordcloud
Creates basic or image specific wordclouds using text and a reference image.
Steps:
1. Collect lyrics into a txt file.
2. Find desireable image. Bigger images have better detail.
3. Use txt file as "text" and image as "image_ref"
4. Play around with the font size. If you have a lot of space which is the same color, a larger font size will fill that space with larger words. 
Smaller font size will appear to even out the image definition but may also spread the words too far apart for good resolution.
5. The background color will be the color that fills empty space. I usually choose white but if you have a black background, you can color it white 
and choose a black background in the program. This will highlight the foreground while still providing you with an original black background.
